<@f.scaffold title="var" logline="Modifiable local variables with a type inferred by assigning value.">
	<@f.history>
		<p>
			<code>var</code> was introduced in lombok 1.16.12 as experimental feature.
		</p>
	</@f.history>

	<@f.experimental>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This feature is very controversial.
			</li><li>
				There is <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286">JEP 286</a> that should make <code>var</code> obsolete.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Current status: <em>uncertain</em> â€“ Currently we feel this feature cannot move out of experimental status.
	</@f.experimental>

	<@f.overview>
		<p>
			<code>var</code> works exactly like <a href="/features/val"><code>val</code></a>, except the local variable is <em>not</em> marked as <code>final</code>.
		</p><p>
			The type is still entirely derived from the mandatory initializer expression, and any further assignments, while now legal (because the variable is no longer <code>final</code>), aren't looked at to determine the appropriate type.<br />
			For example, <code>var x = "Hello"; x = Color.RED;</code> does <em>not</em> work; the type of x will be inferred to be <code>java.lang.String</code> and thus, the <code>x = Color.RED</code> assignment will fail. If the type of <code>x</code> was inferred to be <code>java.lang.Object</code> this code would have compiled, but that's not how<code>var</code> works.

		<dt>
			<code>lombok.var.flagUsage</code> = [<code>warning</code> | <code>error</code>] (default: not set)
		</dt><dd>
			Lombok will flag any usage of <code>var</code> as a warning or error if configured.
